:Microservices
    :An application is divided into a set of loosely coupled, collaborating services.
    :Each service would include
        :Highly maintainable and testable
        :Loosely coupled with other services
        :Independently deployable
        :Capable of being developed by a small team
    :Communication between these services using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP/REST or asynchronous protocols
        such as AMQP
    :These services would have independent Databases[1]
    :Data consistency between services is maintaned using saga pattern[2]
    :Services must be loosely coupled so that they can be developed, deployed and scaled Independently
