# Trees

:Binary Search Tree 
    :Is a node-based binary tree
    :Left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
    :Right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
    :Search, minimum, maximum can be done very fast due to ordering
    :Search space will be reduced from "n" to (n/2), (n/4), (n/8)...
    :BSTs functionality is similar to Binary Search
